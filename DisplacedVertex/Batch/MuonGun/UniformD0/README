The generate.sh script can be used to split and submit generation and reconstruction jobs to the CERN batch system.
The CosmicGeneration.py configuration file is a template where the random seed is changed by the generate.sh script.

The runGeneration.sh script is modified by generate.sh passing the index of the job, used to assign different numbers to the output files, and the random seed.
It is then submitted to the batch system where it runs the generation and reconstruction in series. The output of both jobs is then copied back to castor.

The details about what configuration files to use and where to find them, where to copy the files and the release where to do cmsenv are all in runGeneration.sh.

Note that the rereco_pp_sim.py configuration file is not a template. The runGeneration.sh needs only to know the name of the output and it will be responsible for
changing the name appending an index. This configuration only needs to have the input file matching the output of the CosmicGeneration.py.

The number of events in the job is defined in CosmicGeneration.py.

The number of jobs can be set in the generate.sh script.

To submit the jobs:
./generate.sh
