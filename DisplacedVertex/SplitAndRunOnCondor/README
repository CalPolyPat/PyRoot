The SplitAndRun.py can be used to split and submit jobs to the FNAL condor system.
It can be configured with the release where to do cmsenv.
The configuration file for the job must be templatized with the maxEvents, skipEvents values set to TOTEVENTS and SKIPEVENTS respectively.
The word NUMBER must be introduced in the name of the output, that word will be changed by the script in the number identifying the job (needed to avoid overwrites).

The cfg rereco_pp.py is an example of a template cfg.

The parameters totalEvents and eventsPerJob can be changed in SplitAndRun.py.

To submit the jobs:
python SplitAndRun.py
