GUIDE TO RUNNING TREE PRODUCER

I assume you have :
-checked out a CMSSW area (e.g. 5_2_5)
-checked out the trunk version of the code analysis code
-have access to PAT tuples created by the MakePatTuple step
-the sample cff file corresponding to the PAT tuples of a sample need to be updated with the list of PAT files (see isntructions in MakePatTuples step for more info)



-To run the tree producer on a single sample, do (e.g. from the src directory) :

python TreeProducer/TreeProducer/test/run_treeProducer.py SampleFiles/Samples/python/Data_Mu_Run2012A1_cff.py RAL

Arguments :
1) A sample cff file - make sure the pat file list has been updated
2) Where or how you are running the job.  Currently supports "CERN" and "RAL".

At the moment, this script will submit a number of batch jobs to the batch system on lxplus (or equivalent at RAL)
We can add more functionality here e.g. batch jobs at LPC? Or run crab jobs on published PAT tuples?


-To run the tree producer en masse :

python TreeProducer/TreeProducer/test/runAllTreeProducer.py data CERN

Arguments :
1) Which type of samples to run on.  Choose from:
	
	data 
	signal 
	background 
	qcd 
	vectorboson 
	all

2) Where/how you are running


The jobs will produce histograms_N.root files in the workdirs/SAMPLE_analysis directories. They can be merged by running mergeAllFiles.py from workdirs/:

- cp mergeAllFiles.py mergeFiles.py $LOCALRT/src/workdirs/
- ./mergeAllFiles.py
