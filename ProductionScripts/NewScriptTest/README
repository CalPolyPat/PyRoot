To create the cfg files needed, go in a subdirectory and use the "CreateCfgs.sh" script.
It will start from the cfg already there and generate new ones.

To launch the jobs on the batch queues first modify the batch.cfg configuration file accordingly (in particular all the paths) and then use the "LaunchBatch.py" script.
Using the batch queues is only possible from the lxplus machines.
